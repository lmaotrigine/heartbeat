# API Spec and Client Information

## API Reference

This service exposes an API that clients for all platforms are expected to comply with.

- `POST` `/api/beat`: Ping the server indicating "online" status at this instant.

  **Headers**

    - `Authorization`: A device token (required)

  **Responses**

    - `200`: A Unix timestamp of the time the beat was registered
    - `401`: Invalid or no token provided

- `POST` `/api/devices`: Registers a new device

  **Headers**

    - `Authorization`: The configured secret key for the server.

  **Body**: `application/json`

  A JSON string with a `name` field containing the common name of the device.

  **Responses**

    - `200`: A JSON string containing the device ID, name and token. The token will not be shown again and isn't exposed
      by any endpoint.
    - `401`: Invalid or no secret key provided.
    - `400`: Invalid JSON body

- `POST /api/devices/:id/token/generate`: (Re)generate a token for a device. This will *not* create a new device.

  **Headers**

    - `Authorization`: The configured secret key for the server.
  
  **Path parameters**

    - `id`: The snowflake identifier corresponding to the device
  
  **Responses**

    - `200`: A JSON string containing the device ID, name, and the new token. Any previous tokens associated with this
      device are invalidated.
    - `401`: Invalid or no secret key provided.
    - `400`: Invalid snowflake path parameter.
    - `404`: No device exists with the provided ID.


- `GET` `/api/stats`: Retrieves various statistics about the server.

  **Responses**

    - `200`: A JSON string containing the statistics. This schema is to be considered unstable and prone to breakage
      until a stable version is released. You may refer to the source to get the current schema.

## Existing clients

### Android

A [`Tasker`](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) package can be downloaded from
[TaskerNet][taskernet-link]. There is a task which launches a scene that allows
customizing the server URL and token for your device. You may want to add a shortcut
widget of that task to your home screen.

### \*nix

See [`heartbeat-unix`](https://github.com/lmaotrigine/heartbeat-unix) for a (mostly
universal) example that will run an almost any \*nix system. It is not as portable as
I'd like it to be, and I welcome contributions to add supports for more platforms,
desktop environments, and screensavers.

### Windows

See [`heartbeat-windows`](https://github.com/lmaotrigine/heartbeat-windows) for tools
that help register, configure, and run a client using the Task Scheduler. This is tested
on the latest Windows 11 stable and Insiders build.

### Anything else

Making your own client application for any other platform is as simple as hitting the
ping endpoint with the right `Authorization` header every so often when the device is
"active". The definition of active may vary per device, but it usually means that the
device has been used in the last minute or two, and is currently unlocked (if such
functionality exists). If you'd like your client application listed here, open an
issue/PR linking to it.
