# API Reference

This document is a hand-crafted reference of the entire public API exposed by the server. Care must be taken to keep
this document up-to-date whenever changes are made to the request or response types, or new routes are added or existing
routes removed.

## Devices

Actions relating to devices. These routes are non-existent if the `secret_key` configuration parameter is left empty.

### `POST /api/devices`

Register a new device.

- Authentication: `Authorization` header with the same value as the `secret_key` configuration parameter of the server.
- Request body:
  - Content Type: `application/json`

  - Example: `{"name": "Laptop"}`
- Response:
  - Content Type: `application/json`
  - Schema: 
    ```ts
    {
      id: number,
