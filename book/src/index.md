# Heartbeat

Heartbeat is a service that helps keep track of your digital heartbeat. It works by keeping track of pings from your
devices (or, clients) and keeping track of how long it has been since you last used a device.

Well-behaved clients would normally ping the server only while they are still active (not being used or idle, the
specifics depend on the device), usually once every minute.

This book aims to be a one-stop resource to get your own instance of the heartbeat server and clients up and running.
