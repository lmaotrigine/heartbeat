A service inspired by [5HT2B/heartbeat](https://github.com/5ht2b/heartbeat) implemented in Rust.

## Improvements

This implements a few additional features when compared to upstream. Some of these are still open issues, and may be
implemented soon.

- Token-per-device
- Persistence improvements with a more robust database
- Built-in support for SVG badge generation (using dynamic badges from shields.io leads to long and clunky URLs).
- Hierarchical configuration.

## Compatibility

This service makes some opinionated design changes from upstream in relation to stats, and how devices are added, and
renames the `Auth` header to the more widely accepted `Authorization`, hence existing clients need a bit of tweaking to
be compatible with this server.

## Usage

Documentation for this project is available as a book, and can be viewed [online][book] or in the [`book`](book) directory
in the source tree.
